## Step 0 — Setup & Data Verification

✅ Environment and dependencies installed  
✅ Downloaded complete IPL dataset from Cricsheet  
✅ Verified YAML loading and structure  
✅ Confirmed `deliveries` schema (used from now on)

### Step 1 — Data Parser & Cache
✅ Flattened all IPL YAML files into a single Parquet dataset  
✅ Columns: match_id, season, teams, batsman, bowler, runs, extras, wickets etc.  
✅ Output: `data/processed/ipl_deliveries.parquet`

### Step 2 — Smart Name Resolver (Balanced Semantic Search)

This module (`cricket_tools/smart_names.py`) implements an advanced player-name
resolver that can understand partial, misspelled, or ambiguous inputs.

### Key Features
- Handles **typos**, **initials**, and **surname-only** queries.
- Uses **phonetic** (Metaphone) + **fuzzy** + **semantic** similarity.
- Auto-confirms only when highly confident (balanced thresholds).
- Returns `"ok"`, `"confirm"`, `"ambiguous"`, or `"not_found"` for agent logic.

### Example Usage
```python
from cricket_tools.smart_names import resolve_player_smart
print(resolve_player_smart("Rohitt Sharm"))
''' ('Rohit Gurunath Sharma', 'confirm', 'Did you mean **Rohit Gurunath Sharma**? If not maybe: Mohit Mahipal Sharma, Rahul Sharma.')'''
```

### Step 3 — Player Stats & Role Handlers (`stats.py`, `filters.py`)

This step adds **analytical logic** for batters and bowlers, separating data retrieval from core orchestration.

### Modules and Responsibilities

| File | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| `stats.py` | Computes player-level aggregates (runs, balls, dismissals, strike rate, average, etc.) using the processed deliveries data. |
| `filters.py` | Applies optional filters (season range, venue, team matchup, etc.) to the deliveries DataFrame before aggregation. |

### Functions

```python
from cricket_tools.stats import get_player_stats, get_bowler_stats
```

## Step 4 — ML Prediction Integration (`ml_build.py`, `ml_model.py`, `core.py`)

## Step 4 — ML Prediction Integration (`ml_build.py`, `ml_build_bowl.py`, `ml_model.py`, `core.py`)

This step introduces the **machine-learning layer** that predicts a player’s expected performance —  
both **batting (runs per match)** and **bowling (wickets per match)** — from historical IPL data.

It plugs into the unified API so you can query via:
```python
core.cricket_query(..., role="predict")
````

and is fully integrated with the natural-language agent (Step 5).

---

### 🔁 Pipeline Overview

1. **`ml_build.py`** – aggregates delivery-level records into **batting** features.
2. **`ml_build_bowl.py`** – aggregates delivery-level records into **bowling** features.
3. **`ml_model.py`** – trains two `RandomForestRegressor` models:

   * `performance_model_bat.pkl` for runs per match
   * `performance_model_bowl.pkl` for wickets per match
4. **`core.py`** – routes all `role="predict"` queries to `predict_future_performance()`,
   which automatically selects or combines both models as needed.

### ⚙️ Feature Construction

**Batting features** → `data/processed/ml_features.parquet`
**Bowling features** → `data/processed/ml_features_bowl.parquet`

| Feature (Batting) | Description                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `matches`         | number of unique matches played    |
| `runs`            | total runs scored                  |
| `balls`           | total balls faced                  |
| `dismissals`      | number of times out                |
| `fours`, `sixes`  | boundary counts                    |
| `strike_rate`     | `100 * runs / balls`               |
| `avg`             | `runs / dismissals` (safe-divided) |

| Feature (Bowling)   | Description                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `matches`           | number of unique matches played |
| `balls`             | total balls bowled              |
| `runs_conceded`     | total runs conceded             |
| `wickets`           | total wickets taken             |
| `overs`             | `balls / 6`                     |
| `economy`           | `runs_conceded / overs`         |
| `wickets_per_match` | `wickets / matches`             |

### 🧠 Model Training

Run both builders and model trainers:

```bash
python cricket_tools/ml_build.py
python cricket_tools/ml_build_bowl.py
python cricket_tools/ml_model.py
```

Outputs:

```
✅ Batting model saved: models/performance_model_bat.pkl
✅ Bowling model saved: models/performance_model_bowl.pkl
```

Each model saves metadata (`*_meta.json`) with feature list, training metrics, and timestamps.

---

### 🤖 Unified Predictor

The function `predict_future_performance()` in `ml_model.py`:

* Loads both batting and bowling datasets.
* Runs both models if the player exists in both (e.g. *Bumrah*, *Hardik Pandya*).
* Runs only the available one if player exists in a single dataset.
* Never throws errors for missing roles — gracefully skips absent data.

**Example Output (all-rounder like Bumrah):**

```json
{
  "player": "Jasprit Bumrah",
  "dataset_name": "JJ Bumrah",
  "batting_prediction": {
    "predicted_runs_per_match": 3.58,
    "inputs": { ... }
  },
  "bowling_prediction": {
    "predicted_wickets_per_match": 2.93,
    "inputs": { ... }
  }
}
```

**Example Output (pure batsman):**

```json
{
  "player": "Rohit Sharma",
  "dataset_name": "R Sharma",
  "batting_prediction": { ... }
}
```

---

### 🧩 Integration Notes

* No changes are required in `core.py` or the agent interface.
* Compatible with all backends (`mock`, `semantic`, `openai`).
* Supports both single-role and dual-role players.
* Returns structured JSON suitable for downstream analytics or visualization.

### ✅ Summary of Improvements

| Enhancement             | Description                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Dual-model pipeline** | Separate batting & bowling regressors  |
| **Automatic selection** | Detects available datasets dynamically |
| **All-rounder support** | Runs                                   |

Perfect — since your `CricketAgent`’s `_resolve_backend()` defaults to **OpenAI** when `--backend` is not specified (provided the API key is set), here’s the **corrected Step 5** in the same Markdown format:

## Step 5 — Unified Agent Interface (`agent.py`)

This step introduces a **modular natural-language agent** that understands user queries and routes them to the correct handler.

It supports multiple backends (`mock`, `semantic`, `openai`) and translates free-form questions like:

> “Forecast Bumrah’s form” → calls `cricket_query(..., role="predict")`

---

### File: `cricket_tools/agent.py`

This is the **main CLI and planner** responsible for interpreting and dispatching user queries.

- Parses natural-language inputs like `"Show Rohit Sharma batting average in 2023"`
- Uses the **Smart Name Resolver** (Step 2) for fuzzy player identification
- Detects query intent and determines whether it relates to:
  - **Batting stats**
  - **Bowling stats**
  - **Performance prediction**
- Automatically maps to the correct handler via:
  ```
  from cricket_tools.core import cricket_query
  ```

ensuring unified access to analytics and ML predictions.

### Available Backends

| Backend    | Description                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openai`   | Cloud-based LLM planner (GPT-4o-mini by default). Used **by default** if available. |
| `semantic` | Local vector-search planner using SentenceTransformer embeddings                    |
| `mock`     | Offline, template-based planner for testing and debugging                           |

> **Default behavior:** If no backend is specified and a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present,
> the agent automatically uses the **OpenAI backend**.
> If not, it falls back to **Semantic**, and then to **Mock**.

---

### Running the Agent

```bash
# Default (auto → OpenAI)
python -m cricket_tools.agent "Forecast Bumrah's form"

# Force specific backend
python -m cricket_tools.agent "Show Kohli stats" --backend mock
python -m cricket_tools.agent "What is Rohit's strike rate in 2020?" --backend semantic
python -m cricket_tools.agent "Forecast Bumrah's form" --backend openai
```

---

### Bowling Forecast Support ✅

The unified agent now supports **both batting and bowling prediction workflows** seamlessly.

* If a player exists in **both models** → returns combined results (batting + bowling).
* If a player exists in **only one model** → automatically falls back to that role’s prediction.
* Bowling forecasts use the dedicated model (`perf_bowl_rf.pkl`) for wickets and economy rate.

Example:

```bash
python -m cricket_tools.agent "Forecast Bumrah's form"
```

Output:

```
🎯 Jasprit Bumrah — Bowling Forecast
Predicted wickets per match: 1.8
Predicted economy rate: 6.9
```
